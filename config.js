Pollution from coal plants is responsible for about 23,000 premature death in the EU every year. About 82% of EU, 80% German and virtually all Polish coal power plants do not comply with a new EU regulation on industry air pollution emissions standards that they need to meet by 2021.',

The map illustrates the distribution of the mentioned solar and shows that mine sites located in southern countries, namely in Spain, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria, can benefit from a highly available solar resource, making the conversion of former mine sites for the production of solar energy more attractive.',
