This readme file describes the content of this Indicator package.


## Information

- Name: Total waste generation, excluding major mineral wastes
- Code: WAS
- Id: 1059


### Abstract

Waste excluding major mineral wastes serve as a proxy for trends in total waste production and treatment. It reflects general trends more accurately than statistics on total waste and increases comparability across countries. In fact, total waste generation and treatment are mainly driven by mineral waste from construction/demolition and from mining activities. Waste excluding major mineral wastes reflects waste originating from all economic sectors and households, thus including waste generated from both production and consumption. It does not cover mineral waste and soil, of which 90% originate from the mining and construction sectors.
