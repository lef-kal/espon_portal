### Abstract

The current economy operates mainly on a ‘take-make-dispose’ model – a linear model where every product is bound to reach its ‘end of life’. This leads to a growing pressure of production and consumption on the world’s resources and environment. A circular economy model strives towards using and re-using our resources in a more resource efficient through preserving and enhancing natural capital, optimising natural resource yields by circulating products, components and materials, as well as fostering effective waste management and minimizing detrimental practices.

This dataset provides evidence on the territorial dimension of the transition towards a Circular Economy in Europe by informing on patterns and flows of materials, including resources and waste, as well as on the sectoral distribution of circular economy activities. All datasets are delivered at NUTS-2 level.
